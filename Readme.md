If you want `search` to be a separate executable, you will need to:

1. Modify `search.c` to include a `main` function that parses command-line arguments.
2. Have a mechanism to build and access the tree from `search.c`.
3. Compile `search.c` separately to create its own executable.

However, there is a challenge here: the tree constructed in `trees.c` exists only in the memory space of the `trees` executable while it's running and cannot be accessed by a separate `search` executable after `trees` has terminated.

To overcome this, you can serialize the tree to a file in `trees.c` and then read this file and reconstruct the tree in `search.c`. 

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### 1. Serialize Tree to File in `trees.c`

After constructing the tree, you can write it to a file in a pre-order, in-order, or any other traversal method that can be used to reconstruct the tree.

#### 2. Reconstruct Tree in `search.c`

Read the file and reconstruct the tree in memory before performing the search operation.

#### 3. Implement `main` in `search.c`

Implement a `main` function in `search.c` to parse the command-line arguments and call the `search` function with the reconstructed tree and the input number.

#### 4. Compile `search.c` Separately

Compile `search.c` separately to create its own executable.

### Example

#### 1. Serialize Tree to File in `trees.c`

```c
void serialize_tree(node *root, FILE *file) {
    if (root == NULL) {
        fprintf(file, "# ");
        return;
    }
    fprintf(file, "%d ", root->number);
    serialize_tree(root->left, file);
    serialize_tree(root->right, file);
}

// In main function of trees.c, after constructing the tree
FILE *file = fopen("tree.txt", "w");
if (file == NULL) {
    return 1; // Handle error
}
serialize_tree(tree, file);
fclose(file);
```

#### 2. Reconstruct Tree in `search.c`

```c
node *deserialize_tree(FILE *file) {
    char buffer[10];
    if (fscanf(file, "%s", buffer) != 1) {
        return NULL; // Handle error
    }
    if (buffer[0] == '#') {
        return NULL;
    }
    node *root = malloc(sizeof(node));
    if (root == NULL) {
        return NULL; // Handle error
    }
    root->number = atoi(buffer);
    root->left = deserialize_tree(file);
    root->right = deserialize_tree(file);
    return root;
}

// In main function of search.c, before calling search
FILE *file = fopen("tree.txt", "r");
if (file == NULL) {
    return 1; // Handle error
}
node *tree = deserialize_tree(file);
fclose(file);
```

#### 3. Implement `main` in `search.c`

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s number\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
    int number = atoi(argv[1]);
    if (search(tree, number)) {
        printf("%d found in the tree.\n", number);
    } else {
        printf("%d not found in the tree.\n", number);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 4. Compile `search.c` Separately

```sh
gcc search.c -o search
```

In this approach, you need to run the `trees` executable first to construct the tree and serialize it to a file, and then run the `search` executable to search a number in the serialized tree.
